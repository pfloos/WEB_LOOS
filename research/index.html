<h2 id="multireference-quasiparticles-for-strong-correlation">Multireference quasiparticles for strong correlation</h2>
<p>This project proposes to tackle the problem of describing strong electron correlation by combining two different, yet complementary, approaches: a quantum chemistry description based on multireference wave functions and a condensed matter description based on quasiparticles, hence contemplating the concept of multireference quasiparticles
This project has received financial support from the CNRS through the 80|Prime program, and is also supported through the EUR grant NanoX ANR-17-EURE-0009 in the framework of the ``Programme des Investissements d&rsquo;Avenir&rsquo;'.</p>

<h2 id="habilitation">Habilitation</h2>
<p>My HDR memoir describe succinctly several studies we have been doing on model two-electron systems.
In particular, we introduced a novel class a quasi-exactly solvable systems, shedding new lights on the universality of correlation effects in two-electrons systems.
Second, I present the work we performed on the mathematical properties of a new family of uniform electron gases as well as the development of a new class of density functionals based on this new paradigm.
Third, new recurrence relations for three- and four-electron integrals as well as their fundamental integrals and upper bounds will are discussed.
In particular, our strategy to bound rigorously and efficiently these many-electron integrals is presented.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, my PhD work deals with excited electronic states of macromolecules, such as proteins, enzymes and DNA fragments, as well as the development of QM/MM methods which combine quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics methods.
Martin Karplus, Micheal Levitt and Arieh Warshel have been awarded the 2013 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the seminal development of these methods.</p>
